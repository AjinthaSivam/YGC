It was a beautiful, warm Saturday in October, and Sanduni ’s family had decided to have a picnic.  
Sanduni was helping her mother to get the picnic table ready for their lun ch when the two of her  
married sisters arrived.  
“Happy Birthday, mother! ” they said as they handed over their brightly coloured birthday presents.  
Sanduni had totally forgotten that it was her mother ’s fifty -fourth birthday. She quickly decided to  
find a present that would show her m other how much she loved. She ran upstairs to her bedroom , 
pulled her piggy bank down from its shelf,  and opened it. No coi ns fell out, but as she put her  
fingers inside, she felt a single piece of paper. It was a hundred rupee note.  
She picked it and ran to the gift store next to the shopping centre. As she looked at the pretty dishes  
and other household items, she realized  that her hundred r upees  wouldn ’t be enough to buy what  
she wanted. Suddenly she saw a pretty red flower. It was just the price; ninety nine rupees! She  
took the flower to the cashier and gave the hundred rupee note.  
“Is that all the money you have? ” asked the cashier.  
“Yes”, she said, “just enough to buy this present for my mother. ” “I’m sorry dear. This gift costs  5 
more than what you have. With s ales tax, it costs 108 rupees. ” 
Sanduni felt tears gathering in her eyes. She didn ’t understand sales tax, but all she understood 
was that she wouldn ’t be able to give that beautiful present to her mother.

 Test 15  
Read the following text and  complete the tasks given below . 
Peter was born in Southern England in 1812 when industrial revolution in England was well 
underway. As thousands o f factories were open for business, people left their farms for the cities. 
But their dreams of making more money and improving their lives always did not come true. Men, 
women and even children often exchanged back -breaking work in the field for the bored om and 
danger of factory work.  
Peter's family moved to London when he was five. His father, John, worked as a clerk, so he was 
better off than many people in London. But with his large family and love of entertaining he and 
his wife constantly lived beyond  their means. When Peter was twelve, John was arrested for failing 
to pay a debt. He was sent to debtors' prison where people were kept until they could pay back the 
money they owed.  
Peter was taken out of school and forced to work in a shoe polish factory; wrapping and pasting 
labels on bottles. He worked from dawn to dark, six days a week in a darkroom, lis tening to rats 
squeak beneath the rotting floor boards. His father finally inherited some money, settled his debts 
and was released from jail. Peter later claimed that the factory experience nearly destroyed him.  
The story of Peter's childhood reads like t he story in one of his novels, forced to work at young 
age. Peter suffered long hours and unhealthy conditions common in factories in the nineteenth -
century England. Memories of his experience haunted him for the rest of his life.  
 
Task 1  
State whether the following statements are True , False  or Not given by putting a  
tick (  ) in the relevant column.

given

(2) Some people in farms migrated to cities .    
(3) Working in factories became a tiresome experience for people .
