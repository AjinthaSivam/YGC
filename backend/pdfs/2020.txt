Read the following text and answer the questions given below.  
Life of Sea Otters  
The relationship between a mother and her pup shows the most intimate association  in a sea otter ’s 
life. The adult male provides no parental care, which is typical for most  mammals. However, a 
female sea otter spends a great deal o f time and energy in caring for her offspring,  which depend 
on her for nourishment and protection.  
A mother and her pup are never far apart during the entire time. A pup spends most  of its time 
riding on its mother ’s belly. Even very large pups, six months or older, may still  try to “climb on 
board ”. You can ’t help but feel sorry for a mother struggling to paddle  with a pup nearly her own 
size riding on her stomach!  
A mother ’s protective behaviour towards her offspring is obvious to anyone. Scientists  have made 
interesting observations on mothers ’ and pups ’ behaviour. One mother was found  fondling the dead 
body of a pup and attempting to groom the dead body. In Monterey  Harbour, one female who had 
just lost her  pup was seen mothering a plastic bottle – holding  it under her chin and fondling it as 
if it were her pup. One brave mother actually climbed  into a boat to rescue her large pup.  
While being attentive to their own young, females rarely care for ano ther mother ’s pup, probably 
in part because there ’s little chance that a mother who has lost her own pup  will encounter  an 
orphan.  
A pup gets most of its nourishments by nursing from its mother for the first two  months of its life. 
Although the mot her continues to suckle her pup throughout the dependency  period, the pup 
gradually adds more solid food to its diet.  
A female's two nipples are often visible on her lower abdomen when she is producing  milk. Like 
other marine mammals, sea otters produce mi lk that ’s extremely rich in protein  and fat and low in 
lactose or milk sugar.
