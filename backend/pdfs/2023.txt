animals helped clear away the stuff eating them. The animals, in turn, 
recycled the waste and thus created an even less appealing waste problem.   
2 Many people a re strangely passive when they visit a doctor. First of all, they 
often fail to provide the doctor with complete information about their 
medical problem. Secondly, many people fail to ask their doctor for a full 
and clear explanation of their condition.

sign that your body is working to defend itself. They are often associated 
with an illness such as mumps, German measles, a cold, or flu, but an insect 
bite or an infected cut can a lso result in swelling. Still if swollen glands last 
more than a few days, it can be a sign of a serious illness, such as Hodgkin's 
disease.

Choosing one's fate  
Many years ago, there lived a man who was capable of loving and forgiving everyone he came 
across. Because of this, God sent an angel to talk to him.  
'God asked me to come and visit you and tell you that he wishes to reward you for your goodne ss,' 
said the angel. You may have any gift you wis h for. Would you like the gift  of healing sick people?  
'Certainly not,' said the man. 'I would prefer God to choose those who should be healed." 'And 
what about leading wrong -doers back to the path of good ness?' asked the angel. 'That's a job for

'Look, I can't go back to Heaven without having given you a gift. If you don't choose, I'll h ave to 
choose one for you.' said the angel.  
'The man thought for a moment and then said: 'All right, I would like good to be done  
through me, but no one should notice it. Even I do not want to know it. Otherwise I might  
commit  the offence of becoming a proud person.'

was shining on the man's face. In this way, wherever he went, the sick were healed, the earth grew 
fertile again, and sad people rediscovered happ iness.

he was facing the sun, his shadow was always behind him. In this way, he was able  to live and die 
unaware of his own power of healing.
