1 When settlements were very small, leftovers were simply thrown outdoors, 
where they finally decayed. But as communities grew, pigs and other 
animals helped clear away the stuff eating them. The animals, in turn, 
recycled the waste and thus created an even less appealing waste problem.   
2 Many people are strangely passive when they visit a doctor. First of all, they 
often fail to provide the doctor with complete information about their 
medical problem. Secondly, many people fail to ask their doctor for a full 
and clear explanation of their condition.   
3 Swollen glands in the body can be uncomfortable, but they are a welcome 
sign that your body is working to defend itself. They are often associated 
with an illness such as mumps, German measles, a cold, or flu, but an  insect 
bite or an infected cut can also result in swelling. Still if swollen glands last 
more than a few days, it can be a sign of a serious illness, such as Hodgkin's 
disease.

Read the following text and answer the questions given below.  
Choosing one's fate  
Many years ago, there lived a man  who was capable of loving and forgiving everyone he came 
across. Because of this, God sent an angel to talk to him.  
'God asked me to come and visit you and tell you that he wishes to reward you for your goodness,' 
said the angel. You may have any gift you  wish for. Would you like the gift  of healing sick people?  
'Certainly not,' said the man. 'I would prefer God to choose those who should be healed." 'And 
what about leading wrong -doers back to the path of goodness?' asked the angel. 'That's a job for 
angels like you. I don't want to be worshipped by anyone or to serve as an example for prefect 
living.' replied the man.  
'Look, I can't go back to Heaven without having given you a gift. If you don't choose, I'll have to 
choose one for you.' said the angel.  
'The man thought for a moment and then said: 'All right, I would like good to be done  
through me, but no one should notice it. Even I do not want to know it. Otherwise I might  
commit  the offence of becoming a proud person.'  
So the angel arranged for the man's shadow to have the power of healing, but only when the sun 
was shining on the man's face. In this way, wherever he went, the sick were healed, the earth grew 
fertile again, and sad people rediscovered happiness.  
The man travelled the Earth for many y ears, oblivious  of the healing he was doing because when 
he was facing the sun, his shadow was always behind him. In this way, he was able  to live and die 
unaware of his own power of healing.  
(1) State whether the following statements are True  or False  by putting a tick ( ) in the 
relevant cage. 
 True  False  
(1) God sent an angel to earth to give the man the ability of loving and for giving.    
(2) The man believed that it is God ’s responsibility to select those deserve 
healing.    
(3) The power of healing was active  when the shadow was behind the man.
