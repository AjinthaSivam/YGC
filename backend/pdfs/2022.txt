of his shirt.  
‘So that's where you were!’ she said. ‘How many times have I told you to keep your fingers out  
of my jam jars. I will teach  you a lesson  this time.’  
With  that she marched  him over to the umbrella  stand  next to the door and pulled  out a 
cane.  Tom  knew  he was going  to get it and he had to think  up something  very quickly. ‘Look  out Aunt  Polly!  There  is a rat in the closet.’  He shouted.  
The old lady shrieked  and let go of Tom's  collar.  Before  she discovered  the imaginary  rat, 
Tom  ran out of the door and disappeared  over the fence.  
‘I guess,  I will never  learn,  this boy seems  to have  a new trick up his sleeve  each time I try 
to get him.’  
That evening Tom got late coming home and he decided to climb through the window rather than  
use the front  door.  As he climbed  through  the window,  he found  aunt Polly  waiting for  him.

With  that she closed  the door and walked  out of the room  with a firm resolve  that she 
would  teach  him a lesson  the next day.
