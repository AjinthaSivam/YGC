(1) 
It was my birthday last week and I decided to celebrate it with a few 
friends of mine. I chose a homely place in a quiet part of the town. It is 
one of my favourite restaurants because the food there is cheap, and it      ..............
provides an excellent service. It is hardly crowded, and many people did 
not book a table for the occasion. 
 
(2) 
When  we  came  to  the  restaurant,  I  was  surprised  because  it  was 
completely full. There wasn’t a   single table free. One of the waiters      ..............
recognized me and explained the situation. “A party of tourists have 
come unexpectedly, and the place is full.” 
 
(3) 
The waiter pointed to a table far behind. “The people occupying that 
table are just about to leave” he said. “Just hold on and you will find a    ..............
place there.” He was right. Twenty minutes later, the people occupying 
a table in the middle paid their bill and left the hotel. I got my friends 
there and we all sat down. 
 
(4) 
Unfortunately, our table was almost out of sight. We tried to get the 
attention of the waiter who sent us there, but he, like all the other waiters, 
was busy with the party of tourists. Forty five minutes later, once the        ............
tourists finished their meal, the waiter appeared at our table and he 
looked exhausted. 
 
(5) 
A few moments later the waiter came back to our table. We could tell 
from his face that he had bad news for us. Apologizing to us he informed       ............
that there was no fish or meat left. “All we can offer you is” he said, 
“one omelette each”.
