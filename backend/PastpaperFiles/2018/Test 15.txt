Test 15

Read the following text and answer the questions given below it.

(1) Penguins are one of the world's most interesting birds. They waddle when they walk. They 
have flippers instead of wings. The bones in a penguin's flippers are heavier and more solid 
than  those  in the wings of a flying bird. This helps the penguin ‘fly’ through the water.  
The penguin's black back and white front has an important function too -camouflage in the 
water. Penguins blend in with the sea from above and with the sky from below. This makes 
it harder for predatory birds, leopard seals, sea lions, orcas and sharks to see them. Many 
people think all penguins live in the cold and ice of Antarctica. However, only 6 of the 17 
species or types of penguins live in Antarctica. The others live in parts of New Zealand, 
Australia, South Africa and South America and on the Falkland and Galapagos Islands.
 
(2)  Let's talk about the Emperor penguin of Antarctica. The Emperor penguin is the world's 
largest penguin. Its oily outer feathers help keep it dry. Its dense inner down feathers and 
thick fat layer help keep it warm. Emperor penguins also often huddle in groups to conserve 
heat. A mother Emperor penguin lays only one egg at a time. After the mother Emperor 
penguin lays the egg, she travels to open sea to feed on fish, squid and krill (shrimp-like 
ocean crustaceans). The father stays behind with the egg. He keeps it warm and protected 
by balancing it on his feet and covering it with feathered skin called a brood pouch. The 
mother returns two months later, to feed the newly hatched chick, then stays with it while 
the father goes out to sea to feed. 

(3) The loss of sea ice harms Emperor penguin chicks and adults. Emperor penguins rear their 
chicks on land-locked sea ice. When sea ice breaks up before their chicks have matured 
and grown their waterproof feathers, chicks that are swept into the ocean are likely to die. 
For  adults,  the  loss  of  sea  ice  can  lead  to  lower  food  availability,  which  can  result in increased mortality.
