Test 7

Read the following text and answer the questions.

The pupils stopped talking as Miss Yapa entered the classroom. Then they stood up and greeted, “Good morning, teacher.” Miss Yapa smiled and greeted them back and asked the children to sit down. There were thirty pupils in the class. All the pupils were watching her intently, waiting to know her name. 
“I suppose you want to know my name.” she said. But before she could tell them, someone called out, “You are Miss Yapa.” Everybody laughed including Miss Yapa. 
“News travels quickly.” she said. 
Miss Yapa opened the attendance register and called their names in turn. When she came to the last name on the list, Naveen, she noticed that he had been absent for over a month. 
“What's the matter with Naveen?” asked the teacher. “Naveen has been ill and is still in hospital.” said a girl in the front row. 
“Did you all go to see him?” asked the teacher. No one replied. It was the time to start the lesson. 
“Please tell us a story.” The pupils shouted. 
“No, first of all I want you to write letters to your friend Naveen. We will send the best ones to cheer him up in hospital. I’ll tell you a story, later.”
