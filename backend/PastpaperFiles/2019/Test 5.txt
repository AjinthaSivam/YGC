Geeth  : How was the trip, uncle? 
Uncle  : It was great. Our office 'Environment Club' organized it. 
Geeth  : Where did you go this time? 
Uncle  : This year, we selected a small island in Puttalam. Have you ever been to an island? 
Geeth  : Never, but I would love to. 
Uncle  : Don't worry. I'll take you there during the next vacation. 
Geeth  : By the way, how did you go there? 
Uncle  : We hired a van, and it took 5 hours for us to reach a town close to the island. We   	 spent the night in the circuit bungalow and went to see the island in the morning on 	 a boat. 
Geeth  : Wow! A boat ride?
Uncle  : Yes, one hour ride in the calm sea. The village we visited in the island was very 	 small.Grama Niladhari said it had 105 people. Fishing is what they do for living.     	 Also, I saw some women making beautiful ornaments with seashells. They make money by	 selling them to tourists.
Geeth  : Isn't there a school for children there ?
Uncle  : Well, there is a very small school with a few teachers. That is all.
