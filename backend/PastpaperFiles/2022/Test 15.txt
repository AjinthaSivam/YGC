Test 15

Read the following text and answer the questions given below.  
‘Tom!’ 
The old lady put on her glasses and looked about for him. 
‘Tom!’ she called out again, but there was no response. She walked up to the open door and 
looked out in the garden for him. Just then she heard a noise behind her and she turned around to find Tom sneaking out of the large cupboard in the room. She grabbed him by the  collar of his shirt. 
‘So that's where you were!’ she said. ‘How many times have I told you to keep your fingers out of my jam jars. I will teach you a lesson this time.’ 
With that she marched him over to the umbrella stand next to the door and pulled out a cane.  Tom knew he was going to get it and he had to think up something very quickly. 
‘Look out Aunt Polly! There is a rat in the closet.’ He shouted. 
The old lady shrieked and let go of Tom's collar. Before she discovered the imaginary rat,
Tom ran out of the door and disappeared over the fence. 
‘I  guess, I will never learn, this boy seems to have a new trick up his sleeve each time. I try to  get  him.’ 
That evening Tom got late coming home and he decided to climb through the window rather than 
use the front door. As he climbed through the window, he found aunt Polly waiting for him. 
‘Ah! So you found time to come back!’ She said. ‘Aunt Polly I  ................ 
‘No! don't answer me, I can see that you have been busy, I guess since it is past dinner time 
you would not be hungry, so wash yourself and go to sleep.’ 
With that she closed the door and walked out of the room with a firm resolve that she would  teach him a lesson the next day.
