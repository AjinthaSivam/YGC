	‘Is there someone in your family, maybe your mother, called Jennifer?’ 
(5) ‘Yes’, said the young woman. ‘My mother's name is Jennifer. Why? How did you know 
that?’ 
‘Because you look exactly like the lady who taught me English when I was living in Boston 
in 1950.’ replied the old woman.

teacher.’ ‘Are you sure?’ asked the stranger. ‘Pretty sure,’ she said, but feeling doubtful.
