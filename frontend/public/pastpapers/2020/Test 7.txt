Test 7


Read the following text and underline the correct answer.

I still remember how anxiously I was waiting for our monthly visit to grandma’s house. I was so excited that I couldn’t sleep until the day I left for grandma’s. As soon as we got to grandma’s house, we always went to the kitchen. There, grandma would give us a burning hot bowl of soup and we enjoyed it very much. Grandpa also would give us each a bar of chocolate that melted in our mouths soon. 

Just off the kitchen, was grandma’s living room. High on the wall was an antique clock. At the far end of the room were grandma’s short octagonal cabinets with round tops.
 
Grandma also had a place for us to play. It was the old garage. There were some cars, not just regular cars but wonderful old cars. When the engines of those cars started, they sounded like lions roaring.
 
When the time came to leave grandma’s house, we were always sad. We would miss grandma’s 
fresh glass of milk in the morning and grandpa’s loud laughter. Sometimes we would hide under 
grandma’s great big bed hoping our parents would leave without us. Eventually, they always found us.
