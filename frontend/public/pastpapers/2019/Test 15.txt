Test 15

Read the following text and complete the tasks given below. 

Peter was born in Southern England in 1812 when industrial revolution in England was well 
underway. As thousands of factories were open for business, people left their farms for the cities. 
But their dreams of making more money and improving their lives always did not come true. Men, women and even children often exchanged back-breaking work in the field for the boredom and danger of factory work.
 
Peter's family moved to London when he was five. His father, John, worked as a clerk, so he was better off than many people in London. But with his large family and love of entertaining he and his wife constantly lived beyond their means. When Peter was twelve, John was arrested for failing to pay a debt. He was sent to debtors' prison where people were kept until they could pay back the money they owed. 

Peter was taken out of school and forced to work in a shoe polish factory; wrapping and pasting labels on bottles. He worked from dawn to dark, six days a week in a darkroom, listening to rats squeak beneath the rotting floor boards. His father finally inherited some money, settled his debts and was released from jail. Peter later claimed that the factory experience nearly destroyed him. 

The story of Peter's childhood reads like the story in one of his novels, forced to work at young age. Peter suffered long hours and unhealthy conditions common in factories in the nineteenth-century England. Memories of his experience haunted him for the rest of his life.
