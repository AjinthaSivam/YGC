				    The Blue Whale 

The world's largest mammal is the blue whale.
 
Although they can breathe air, blue whales are most at ease in the ocean, where their ability to float supports their amazing size. These marine animals can be found in every ocean on Earth, and they frequently swim alone or in tiny groups. 

A blue whale calf is born weighing two tons (approximately 1814 kg) and during its first year of life, it gains an additional 200 pounds (approximately 91 kg) every day. These enormous animals consume krill, which are tiny organisms that resemble shrimp. 

It is estimated that just a small number of blue whales inhabit the oceans worldwide. They were nearly driven to extinction because of years of hunting for their oil and blubber. Although they were shielded from extinction by the 1966 International Whaling Convention, they are currently listed as endangered.
