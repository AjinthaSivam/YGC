Test 15

Read the following text and answer the questions given below.
		
				Choosing one's fate

Many years ago, there lived a man who was capable of loving and forgiving everyone he came 
across. Because of this, God sent an angel to talk to him. 
'God asked me to come and visit you and tell you that he wishes to reward you for your goodness,' said the angel. You may have any gift you wish for. Would you like the gift of healing sick people?
 
'Certainly not,' said the man. 'I would prefer God to choose those who should be healed." 'And what about leading wrong-doers back to the path of goodness?' asked the angel. 'That's a job for angels like you. I don't want to be worshipped by anyone or to serve as an example for prefect living.' replied the man. 

'Look, I can't go back to Heaven without having given you a gift. If you don't choose, I'll have to choose one for you.' said the angel. 
'The  man  thought  for  a  moment  and  then  said:  'All  right,  I  would  like  good  to  be  done through me, but no one should notice it. Even I do not want to know it. Otherwise I might commit the offence of becoming a proud person.'
 
So the angel arranged for the man's shadow to have the power of healing, but only when the sun was shining on the man's face. In this way, wherever he went, the sick were healed, the earth grew fertile again, and sad people rediscovered happiness. 
The man travelled the Earth for many years, oblivious of the healing he was doing because when he was facing the sun, his shadow was always behind him. In this way, he was able to live and die unaware of his own power of healing.
